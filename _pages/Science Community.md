I enjoy finding ways to facilite better science communication.

WashU is especially strong in imaging sceince. We have PhDs from many departments and all working on researches related to imaging science.

Together with Aahana Bajracharya, Maria Medrano, and Chunhui Yang, we initiated monthly __imaging science student seminar__ in the fall of 2019. We invited PhD students from different programs to share their awesome imaging researches to our audience, e.g., MRI, CT, OCT, fluorescnece imaging, machine learning on imaging ...

We also build our own website for sharing the recorded presentations. [Website](https://sites.wustl.edu/imagingscienceseminar/)

Nile red, a fluorescent emitter, transiently binds to the lipid bilayers at a certain orientation and emit fluorescence light. Our pixel-wise optimized phase mask is placed at the back focal plane of the microscope to modulate the phase of fluorescence light. After modulation, the shape of point spread function enables us to measure the 3D orientation and 3D position of Nile red simultaneously.

The pixOL microscope enables super-resolution imaging of the 3D locations and 3D orientations of fluorescent molecules. The 6-dimensional images from pixOL depict Nile red molecules (NR, red bars) as they transiently bind to a spherical lipid bilayer (SLB, gray structures around the sphere). The top two rows show the orientations of NR (each line represents the long axis of the molecule) at different z-slices through the sphere (left to right). With cholesterol (aqua ellipses) present in the SLB, we observe that NR becomes more ordered and perpendicular to the sphere (top row); without cholesterol present to organize the membrane, NR exhibits various orientations (second row). Scale bar: 400 nm.
