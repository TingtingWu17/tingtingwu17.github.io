In every science activity, I benefit both as a presenter by further understanding my own science from the perspectives of my audience and as a listener by learning new science from my intelligent colleagues.

I enjoy communicating my science using different languages when facing different audiences and building platforms to facilitate better science communication.

WashU has PhDs from many departments and is working on imaging science-related research, e.g., MRI, CT, OCT, fluorescence imaging, machine learning on imaging ...

Together with Aahana Bajracharya, Maria Medrano, and Chunhui Yang, we initiated monthly imaging science student seminars starting in the fall of 2019. We invited Ph.D. students from different programs to share their awesome imaging research with our audiences. Till the end of April 2022, we already hold around 20 seminars.

During the pandemic time, we decided to build our ['imaging science library](https://sites.wustl.edu/imagingscienceseminar/) where we shared our presenters' presentations after their seminars. We hope this library will help new students find the labs they are interested in, and help existing students know more about the imaging science happening at WashU.

### <span style="color:teal; font-family:cursive;font-size: 15px;"> Science Coach Program in WashU</span>
<img src="/_pages/files/Science_coach.jpg" align="right" width="200px"/>
I am a science coach in the event organized by Association of Graduate Engineering Students (AGES) at WashU.

We meet high school students and facilitate them to brainstorm research projects. I am flattered that one student was inspired by our imaging demo and come up with an idea of how the color of stars is related to their distance to the center of the milky way galaxy.

I gave a talk titled "engineering the point spread function of single-molecule microscopy through Fourier transform" on [Math Camp](https://wiry-salary-f6f.notion.site/Signals-and-Systems-78355b8113364656bf485c96a8d7e7bb) in WashU.

<span style= "font-size: 13px;">Nile red, a fluorescent emitter, transiently binds to the lipid bilayers at a certain orientation and emit fluorescence light. Our pixel-wise optimized phase mask is placed at the back focal plane of the microscope to modulate the phase of fluorescence light. After modulation, the shape of point spread function enables us to measure the 3D orientation and 3D position of Nile red simultaneously. </span>

<span style= "font-size: 13px;">The pixOL microscope enables super-resolution imaging of the 3D locations and 3D orientations of fluorescent molecules. The 6-dimensional images from pixOL depict Nile red molecules (NR, red bars) as they transiently bind to a spherical lipid bilayer (SLB, gray structures around the sphere). The top two rows show the orientations of NR (each line represents the long axis of the molecule) at different z-slices through the sphere (left to right). With cholesterol (aqua ellipses) present in the SLB, we observe that NR becomes more ordered and perpendicular to the sphere (top row); without cholesterol present to organize the membrane, NR exhibits various orientations (second row). Scale bar: 400 nm.</span>
