- The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers widtom.  --Isaac Asimov
- So, what if we consider the possibility that the creators are not human minds? What if we were not the dominant actors on Earth we thought we were, but the products and subjects of others?  -- Julla Lohmann @ MIT Musuem
- As a scientist, I take pride in setting my own goals, in using creativity and intuition to tackle a broad range of unsolved problems, and in using language to share what I discover. Fortunately for me, society is willing to pay me to do this as a job. -- Max Tegmark @ <Life 3.0>
