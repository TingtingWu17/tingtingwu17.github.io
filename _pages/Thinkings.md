- Outliers are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky -- but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.   -- Malcolm Gladwell @ [Outliers]
- The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.  --Isaac Asimov
- So, what if we consider the possibility that the creators are not human minds? What if we were not the dominant actors on Earth we thought we were, but the products and subjects of others?  -- Julla Lohmann @ MIT Musuem
- As a scientist, I take pride in setting my own goals, in using creativity and intuition to tackle a broad range of unsolved problems, and in using language to share what I discover. Fortunately for me, society is willing to pay me to do this as a job. -- Max Tegmark @ <Life 3.0>

## 2024
2024, I live without ‘what looks good’ but with ‘what feels good’. 

I am not a workaholic, not living for taking beautiful pictures, not living for big success, not living for making more friends, not living for more social events, not living for attending one-time off activities. 

I find more happiness in living in the moment. I love my body more after dancing every week; I do hour-long running without anything on my head, the training process solid my belief that ‘everything is about training’; I read books, books, and books without feeling in a hurry to do other things; I put English learning into my daily routine and treat it as year-long or life-long devotion; I cut my social events to only focus on well-connected friendships; I put hours into volunteer in the museum to enjoy those creative science events and to work with family, kids, and elderlies. More, I am learning to slow down to love the moment more.
