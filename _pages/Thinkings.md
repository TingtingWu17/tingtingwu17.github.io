- Outliers are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky -- but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.   -- Malcolm Gladwell @ <outliers>
- The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.  --Isaac Asimov
- So, what if we consider the possibility that the creators are not human minds? What if we were not the dominant actors on Earth we thought we were, but the products and subjects of others?  -- Julla Lohmann @ MIT Musuem
- As a scientist, I take pride in setting my own goals, in using creativity and intuition to tackle a broad range of unsolved problems, and in using language to share what I discover. Fortunately for me, society is willing to pay me to do this as a job. -- Max Tegmark @ <Life 3.0>
