I am a Ph.D. student in Lewlab [LewLab](https://lewlab.wustl.edu/), [Imaging Science Program](https://engineering.wustl.edu/academics/programs/imaging-science/index.html) 
in Washington University in St. Louis. 

I am working on single-molecule orientation localization microscopy (SMOLM). In Lew lab, I design the microscope to measure the 6-dimentional information (orientation, wobble, 3D position) of single molecules.
